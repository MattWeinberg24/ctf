0. cat .backup/bookmarks.html | grep "leviathan"
1. Run with gdb
   Break at the location strcmp is called in main
   check the contents of the stack and test each word (outside of gdb)
   When a shell is spawned, cat the password
2. ltrace ./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2
   Notice it passes user input to a system call with /bin/cat
   cat treats filenames with spaces as two different filenames
   make a temporary directory
   create a filename with a space in it: touch password\ fake
   make a symbolic link between a file with the name corresponding to the first word in the previous command: ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3 password
   supply the space-file to printfile and the password should appear
   This is because it passes the access() check with the full space-filename, but only prints a file corresponding to the first word
